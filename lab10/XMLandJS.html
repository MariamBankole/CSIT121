		<h2>What is XML?</h2>
		<p>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a way to format data in a structured format that is easy for computers to read. XML is often used for data exchange between different systems and applications. It is a flexible language that allows users to define their own tags and document structure.</p>

		<h2>How is XML used?</h2>
